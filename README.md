Final project for COE538.

Objective is to get an EEBOT to follow the track and make it to the end of the maze. 

To accomplish the project task, the eebot will require a number of subsystems integrated into a complete program.
These include:
• Navigation Manager Software routines that manage the navigation of the robot, for example, during
search mode for the guide track.
• Guidance Routine Routine that interprets guider readings and commands the motors appropriately when
following the guide track.
• Sensor Scanner Reads the photodetector sensors and thresholds the readings to determine when a track is
in view.
• Motor Speed Control Controls the relative speeds of the motors to steer the robot and execute turns.
• Rotation Counters Used when executing accurate turning manoevres.
• Bumper Detectors Detect when the robot has collided with an object
